# Analysis of Gender Bias in Statistical Journals
The goal of the project is to assess whether gender bias exists in statistical journals, and in the academic Statistics world in general. To do so, we determine whether there is a significant disparity in citation counts between papers with male and female (first) authors, that cannot be explained by common confounding factors such as seniority (job title) or country of employment. The data was collected by scraping data from the four largest statistical journals, Google scholar, and the Mathematics Geneology Project.
